## **Reticulate** ![](/blog/2020-05-08-blog-post_files/reticulated_python.png){width=200px height=200px}

Hi y'all!
This is blog post.
A post in a blog for SDS348: Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.

Today, we'll be talking about **RETICULATE**

Reticulate is a nifty R package that allows R and Python to *communicate*

### R
```{R}
library(reticulate)
number <- (67+88)*4
```

### Python
```{python}
number = 2*5/14
print(r.number*number)
```
Here, I gave R some arithmatic to complete and saved it as number. I also gave python some arithmatic and saved it. I then asked python to multiply those two numbers together and print the resulting number.
